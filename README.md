- There are 2 files and one folder containing the raw data in the repo in addition to this Read.me. In general, code was written to match the output in specific cells of the provided jupyter notebook file. Some comments about the coding:
- I used code in `climate_starter.ipynb` to determine the end date of the entire population of data and the population filtered by most active station (which turns out to be not the same dates), and the date one year prior to these two respective end dates. Coding was somewhat challenging as dates in the sqlite file are strings and had to be converted. Even though I could have simply included the string in the filter queries, instead of a variable, I thought this coding would be useful for increasing my knowledge base. Handling date and time in data analytics code appears somewhat complex, but it appears to be ubiquitous. Indeed, figuring the x-axis labels of the bar plot was likewise challenging. I did use the string instead of a variable in the `SurfsUp_app.py`. 
- With so many ways to code bar graphs, I did the one that matched the solution. 
- The assignment stated that the precipitation route returns json with the date as the key and the value as the precipitation; this means that because the dataset contains multiple values of precipitation for the same date (from 9 different stations), the precipitation value displayed is the last one read, and therefore could change when running the API another time.
